Simulation Software
-------------------

The hallmark of the CG is the ability to generate 1 model in ``cluster_generator`` and export it to a variety of simulation codes
with ease. On this page, we've provided a list of the various simulation software we support and some software specific tips on
how to use each of them.

.. _flash:

``FLASH``
=========

|medium-support| |req-ext| |AMR| |documentation_bad|

The ``FLASH`` 3.0 hydrodynamics code [FrOlRi]_ (developed at the `University of Chicago <http://flash.uchicago.edu>`_) is an all purpose simulation
code which relies on adaptive mesh refinement and the piecewise-parabolic method (PPM).

The ``FLASH`` simulation setup ``GalaxyClusterMerger`` can be used with the
inputs to ``cluster_generator`` to perform a single-cluster simulation or a
binary merger. ``GalaxyClusterMerger`` has two modes in which it can be run in:
``RigidGravity``, which uses rigid potentials to represent the dark matter and
stars, or ``SelfGravity``, which represents the dark matter and stars as
particles. ``GalaxyClusterMerger`` also supports the inclusion of a tangled
magnetic field in the simulations.

.. admonition:: Info
    The ``GalaxyClusterMerger`` setup is currently available from John ZuHone by
    request for users who have a licensed copy of the ``FLASH`` code.

``GAMER``
=========

|fully-supported| |AMR| |documentation_bad|

``GAMER`` (GPU-accelerated Adaptive MEsh Refinement code [ScTsCh]_) utilizes a modified AMR approach designed
to utilize the acceleration potential of GPUs.
The ``GAMER`` simulation setup ``ClusterMerger`` can be used with the inputs to
``cluster_generator`` to perform a single-cluster simulation, binary merger, or
a triple merger. The required, optional, and recommended ``Makefile`` options
for the ``ClusterMerger`` setup are as follows:

* ``SIMU_OPTION += -DMODEL=HYDRO`` (required)
* ``SIMU_OPTION += -DGRAVITY`` (required)
* ``SIMU_OPTION += -DPARTICLE`` (required)
* ``SIMU_OPTION += -DNCOMP_PASSIVE_USER=n`` (required, n = ``Merger_Coll_NumHalos+Merger_Coll_UseMetals``, see below )
* ``SIMU_OPTION += -DMHD`` (optional, for simulations with magnetic fields)
* ``SIMU_OPTION += -DEOS=EOS_GAMMA`` (required)
* ``SIMU_OPTION += -DPAR_NATT_USER=2`` (required, supports the type and halo attributes)
* ``SIMU_OPTION += -DGPU`` (recommended)
* ``SIMU_OPTION += -DLOAD_BALANCE=HILBERT`` (recommended)
* ``SIMU_OPTION += -DOPENMP`` (recommended)
* ``SIMU_OPTION += -DSUPPORT_HDF5`` (required)

``Arepo``
=========

|fully-supported| |SPH| |documentation_easy|

``Arepo`` [WeSpPa]_ is a smooth-particle hydrodynamics simulation software developed at the `Max-Planck Institute for Astrophysics <https://arepo-code.org/wp-content/userguide/index.html>`_.
CG can be used to create HDF5-based initial conditions for
one, two, or three clusters for an idealized merger simulation for the Arepo code.
The way to do this is to create a Gadget-like HDF5 initial conditions file:

After generating the initial conditions file, the ICs will need to be processed
through two steps before the simulation proper can be run. The first step is to
add a background grid of cells to the particle distribution. This is done with
the ``ADD_BACKGROUND_GRID`` Config option in Arepo. The Arepo configuration
options to be enabled in ``Config.sh`` for this step include:

``RAMSES``
==========

|fully-supported| |req-ext| |AMR| |documentation_medium| |MOND|

The ``RAMSES`` code is a multipurpose AMR software developed by `Romain Teyssier <https://bitbucket.org/rteyssie/ramses/src/master/>`_. Because of its
support for minimally invasive patching, ``RAMSES`` supports a variety of options for non-newtonian gravity, sub-grid physics, and other
adaptations. In particular, ``RAMSES`` is the only code supported by CG which is capable of performing MONDian simulations.

Due to the variety of options regarding setting up ``RAMSES`` for use with CG, interested users should read the guide below for a
full breakdown of what can be done with ``RAMSES`` and ``CG``.
