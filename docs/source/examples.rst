Examples
========

This section of the documentation lays out examples for how to do a variety of tasks.
Most of the early, simple code demonstrations are small scripts which you can easily copy and paste into your own code;
however, as we move to more complex tasks, the recipes move to iPython notebooks to display intermediate steps.
All of these recipes are available for download in a link next to the recipe.
