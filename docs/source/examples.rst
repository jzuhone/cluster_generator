    .. card:: Your First Journey with CG
        :link: _notebooks/examples/FirstJourney
        :link-type: doc

        Learn the basics of CG while taking a model of galaxy cluster Abell 133
        all the way from literature to RAMSES simulation. This guide will show you
        the basic pipeline from analytical profiles to actually running a simulation.

    .. card:: Correcting Non-Physical Behaviors

        In this guide, we consider the cluster A133 and its analytical model, which is
        non-physical in certain radii. We show the tools available for correcting these
        issues.
